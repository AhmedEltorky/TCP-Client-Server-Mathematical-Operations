# TCP Client Server Mathematical Operations


### This is client/server program using connection-oriented sockets, the server receive client requests then perform mathematical operation based on the client input then return the result to the client.

#### Requirement for the client program:
- Read sequence of numbers from the user
- Read the operator from the user (+ , - and *)
- Send all the data on the socket to the server
- Receive the results from the socket and print it to the user

#### Requirements for the server program:
- Handle user connection request
- Read sequence of numbers from the socket
- Read the operator from the user (+ , - and *)
- perform the arithmetic operation on all numbers
- send the results to the client
